- 👋 Hi, I’m @lucyverne
- 👀 I’m interested in coding(obviously), simracing, building custom PCs/keyboards, music- both listening and creating/playing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nextgenstyle vm's (read as 'current-gen' cause I'm not very updated) with node/react
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing in particular, but hit me up for some nextgen jazzimbo if you want
- 📫 Reach me via pm's on here

Gonna try setting up a repo which builds a vm based on Manjaro w KDE Plasma and installs some react/Node.js app - which I'm hoping is possible with all the nice stuff going on 'nowadays'.
As I've interpreted what's possible today; I should be able to just git pull and then <insert-builder> build on whatever PC and be done w. it
